## MySQL-Concepts-in-SQL

This repository showcases my work and progress from an intermediate MYSQL course. The course covered a range of SQL concepts, some of which were more advanced, including transactions, views, triggers, and events. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to work with various SQL concepts and implement them effectively within a database.


By completing this project, I have achieved the following learning objectives:

*Understand Data Manipulation Language (DML) Concepts:
I gained a strong understanding of how to use DML commands such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT to modify and query data in SQL databases.

*Understand Transaction Control Language (TCL) Concepts:
I learned how to manage transactions using commands like START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK to ensure data consistency and integrity.

*Understand Views in SQL:
I created views, which are virtual tables used to simplify querying and present data in a more user-friendly format.

*Understand Triggers in SQL:
I practiced creating triggers, which are automated actions that occur when specific database events (such as data changes) happen.

*Understand Events in SQL:
I set up events to automate scheduled tasks in the database, such as inserting data at specific times.

**Final Thoughts
Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience working with core SQL concepts such as DML, TCL, views, triggers, and events. This project has helped me build a solid foundation for performing data manipulation and automation tasks within a relational database.
